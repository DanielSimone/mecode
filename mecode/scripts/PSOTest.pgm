' This sample demonstrates a use of the PSO pulse generator that is not tied to the
' position of the axis in any way.  The pulse generator is configured and forced to
' fire a single time.

' NOTE: All PSO samples are written assuming 1000 counts per unit.
' NOTE: PSO pulse outputs are intentionally long so that the PSO output state can
'       be easily viewed using the "PSO Status" item in the Digital Scope.


' Reset the PSO.
PSOCONTROL Y RESET

' Uncomment the following line to configure the PSO hardware to send the PSO signal out the
' auxiliary marker.  If using the dedicated PSO output, this command should not be used.
' Refer to your drive hardware manual for more information.
'PSOOUTPUT X CONTROL 0 1

' Configure the pulse generator by setting the pulse on/off times and number of cycles.
PSOPULSE Y TIME 1000000, 500000 CYCLES 3

' Specify the output of the PSO to come from the pulse generator.
PSOOUTPUT Y PULSE

' Enable the PSO and force it to fire immediately.
